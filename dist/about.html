        <p>Hello! My name is Alex Gunic I  am a student of IT Škola.  
          I'm 20 years old. Currently I am uneployed because I'm focusing all of my time to learn web developement and programming as best as I can. Previously I worked at a company called Hilti In Hungary as a cnc machine operator, but as you can see I realized that it's not what I want to do for a living so I started to learn web development.

        <p>I educated in CNC machine programming and operation at the school of Ivan Sarić Tehnička Škola in Subotica. I was one of the best students in terms of cnc programming knowledge in my class.
        I achieved 4th place on the national level competition of cnc programming. In my free time I go to the gym and I like to tinker with electrical and mechanical stuff. </p>
